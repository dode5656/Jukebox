# Jukebox
A Music Bot I made!!

This music bot was made using this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LmY8VzUTBU&list=PLVzaElkTvlQae8XJ0ujnEgz1GviufNx8h) from a core developer at discord.js. Go show him some appreciation, his tutorial is amazing.

# Installation

You can clone this repo by doing `git clone https://github.com/dode5656/Jukebox.git`
Then you can just initialize the environment by doing `npm init` and install the required packages by doing `npm install`.

You have to replace `REPLACEPLEASE` in the botconfig.json file with the required stuff. `token` is the Discord Bot token, `YTAPI` is the Youtube Data v3 API key, `ownerid` is the User ID of the person who you want to access `restart` command.

You need FFMPEG for the bot to work and play music, otherwise it will error and possibly crash.
